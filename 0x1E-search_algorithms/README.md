0x1E. C - Search Algorithms C Algorithm Cohort


The provided instructions outline a programming project focused on implementing and understanding various search algorithms in the C programming language.
The tasks involve creating functions for linear search, binary search, jump search, interpolation search, exponential search, advanced binary search, and
linear search within a skip list. Each task includes specific requirements such as allowed editors, compilation instructions, and adherence to a coding style.
Additionally, the project requires writing Big O notations for time and space complexities and involves searching for values in arrays and linked lists.
The code must be organized in a GitHub repository with designated directories and files for each task.
